# Data Engineering Project

This project focuses on the following key areas of data engineering:

- **Data Extraction:** In this phase, raw data is collected from various sources such as databases, APIs, or files. The goal is to gather all the necessary data required for further processing.

- **Data Transformation:** Once the raw data is extracted, it needs to be transformed into a structured format that is suitable for analysis. This involves cleaning, aggregating, and enriching the data to make it more valuable and easier to work with.

- **Data Loading:** The final step involves loading the transformed data into a destination where it can be accessed and analyzed efficiently. This could be a data warehouse, a database, or any other storage system depending on the project requirements.

By effectively managing these three stages of the data engineering process, this project aims to build a robust data pipeline that ensures the availability of high-quality data for analysis and decision-making.
